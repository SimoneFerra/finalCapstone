Project name: Finance Calculators

Project description: the program runs two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.
                     The user can choose the calculator needed and by entering some values the program will make the requested calculations. 

Installation: the project can be installed locally using Python.

Usage: the program starts asking to select 'investment', if the user wants to calculate the amount of interest you'll earn on your investment, or 'bond', if the user wants to calculate the amount you'll have to pay on a home loan.
If 'investment' is selected the user have to enter the amount of money to deposit, the interest rate desired, the number of years planned for the investment and finally choose from 'simple interest' or 'compound interest'.
After that a message will show the amount of money the user earn from the investment.
If 'bond' is selected the user have to enter the present value of the house, the interest rate desired, the number of months over which the bond will be repaid and then a message will show the amount of monthly repayment.
